# Data and Codes from the article "The Atlantic Tropical Instability Waves: Interdecadal Variability, Shifts, Characteristics, and Energetics"

This repository contains the processed data from the altimeter L4 data from Copernicus Marine, filtered at representative latitudes within 9°S and 9°N (data/data_filtered_lat), along with the code used to filter it (codes/filtering).

The data from the baroclinic and barotropic energy calculated from GLORYS reanalysis, as well and it's trends, are availiable at data/data_energy. The codes to calculate the energy are in codes/energy.

The data from the energy peaks and trends calculated by applying the wavelet transform in the filtered altimeter data are in data/data_peak_energy. The codes to apply the wavelet transform and indentify the peaks are in codes/tiw_activity.

For any additional data request or code explanation, please send an email to anaclarabmariani@gmail.com.
